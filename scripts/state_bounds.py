state_bounds.py -- one bounding box per state, and the "is this row plotted in
the state it claims" check that reads them.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
In July 2026 a duplicate `id` in data/proposals.csv merged six Pennsylvania
projects with six projects in other states. The joins fanned out silently and
baseline_universe.csv published, among others, "Nebius Butler Township Data
Center", Schuylkill County PA, at 32.507, -91.647 -- Richland Parish,
Louisiana, under operator "Meta". Nothing errored. The contradiction between a
row's own `state` column and its own coordinates was visible in the published
artifact for weeks and no gate looked at it.

assert_unique_project_ids() in project_resolution.py now stops that particular
cause. This module is the more general check: whatever the cause, a row whose
coordinates are not in the state it names is wrong, and saying so is cheap.

WHAT THESE BOXES ARE FOR
------------------------
Catching gross contradictions -- a Pennsylvania project in Louisiana -- not
adjudicating borders. Each box is the state's extent padded by PAD degrees, so
a site legitimately sitting on a state line does not trip it. A box is a
rectangle and a state is not, so a point can be inside the box and outside the
state (the Florida panhandle's box covers part of Georgia). That asymmetry is
deliberate: this check produces no false positives at the cost of missing
near-miss errors, which is the right trade for a blocking gate.

Alaska carries two boxes because the Aleutians cross the antimeridian and a
single rectangle would either miss them or span the globe.

Coordinates are (min_lat, max_lat, min_lon, max_lon).
